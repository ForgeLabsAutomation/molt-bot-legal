## 1) What Pipeline Bot Does
Pipeline Bot is an automation assistant that can:
- Read messages in channels where it is authorized (e.g., “orders/intake” channels)
- Trigger automation workflows (e.g., task planning, queue processing, posting results)
- Post outputs to designated output channels (e.g., summaries, review packets, logs)
- Optionally call external services and APIs (e.g., AI model providers, calendars, CRMs) depending on configuration

Pipeline Bot may run on self-hosted infrastructure controlled by you or your organization.
