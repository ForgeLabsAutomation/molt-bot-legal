# Terms of Service — Pipeline Bot
**Effective Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern access to and use of **Pipeline Bot**, an automation bot operated by **ForgeLabs Automation** (“ForgeLabs,” “we,” “us,” “our”). By installing, using, or interacting with Pipeline Bot, you agree to these Terms.

> **Not Legal Advice.** This document is provided for informational purposes and is not legal advice. You should consult a qualified attorney to ensure your policies fit your jurisdiction and use case.

---

## 1) What Pipeline Bot Does
Pipeline Bot is an automation assistant that can:
- Read messages in channels where it is authorized (e.g., “orders/intake” channels)
- Trigger automation workflows (e.g., task planning, queue processing, posting results)
- Post outputs to designated output channels (e.g., summaries, review packets, logs)
- Optionally call external services and APIs (e.g., AI model providers, calendars, CRMs) depending on configuration

Pipeline Bot may run on self-hosted infrastructure controlled by you or your organization.

---

## 2) Eligibility and Authority
You represent that you are authorized to:
- Install Pipeline Bot in a Discord server, workspace, or environment you control or administer, and
- Grant the permissions required for it to operate.

If you use Pipeline Bot on behalf of an organization, you represent you have authority to bind that organization.

---

## 3) Acceptable Use
You agree not to use Pipeline Bot to:
- Break the law or violate third-party rights
- Transmit malware, exploit vulnerabilities, or perform unauthorized access
- Harass, threaten, or harm others
- Attempt to extract secrets, tokens, credentials, or private data from systems
- Use the bot to post or process content that violates platform policies (Discord, etc.)

We may suspend or disable access if we reasonably believe usage violates these Terms or creates risk.

---

## 4) Admin Responsibility and Configuration
Server/workspace admins control where Pipeline Bot can operate by:
- Discord permissions (channels, roles)
- Workflow configuration (which channels are treated as intake/output)
- Integration settings (which external services are enabled)

You are responsible for:
- Correctly configuring channel allowlists/denylists
- Ensuring the bot does not have more permissions than needed (least privilege)
- Managing credentials and secrets securely (see “Security” below)

---

## 5) Outputs, Accuracy, and Reliability
Pipeline Bot outputs (including any AI-generated text) may be incomplete, inaccurate, or outdated. You agree that:
- **You will not rely on Pipeline Bot output as professional advice** (legal, medical, financial, security, compliance, etc.).
- You are responsible for reviewing and approving any action or content before using it externally or in production.

We do not guarantee uninterrupted operation, or that workflows will always produce correct results.

---

## 6) Third-Party Services
Pipeline Bot may integrate with third-party services (e.g., Discord, AI model providers, hosting providers, calendar APIs). Your use of those services is governed by their terms.

Depending on your configuration, some message content and metadata may be sent to third parties to provide functionality (see Privacy Policy).

---

## 7) Security
You are responsible for securing your deployment, including:
- Storing secrets in a secure vault/credential manager (not in Discord messages or repos)
- Rotating tokens and API keys when needed
- Restricting bot permissions and channel access
- Keeping your automation stack updated (n8n, database, gateway services, etc.)

While we may provide guidance, **you are responsible for your security posture**.

---

## 8) Intellectual Property
You retain ownership of your content. We retain ownership of Pipeline Bot software, branding, and documentation (except where otherwise stated).

If you provide feedback, you grant us the right to use it to improve the service without obligation.

---

## 9) Termination
You can stop using Pipeline Bot at any time by removing it from your server/workspace and disabling workflows.

We may suspend or terminate access if:
- Required to comply with law
- Necessary to prevent abuse or security risks
- You violate these Terms

---

## 10) Disclaimers
PIPELINE BOT IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE,” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, FORGELABS WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA, PROFITS, OR REVENUE ARISING FROM YOUR USE OF PIPELINE BOT.

OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR ANY CLAIM RELATING TO PIPELINE BOT WILL NOT EXCEED THE AMOUNT YOU PAID (IF ANY) TO USE PIPELINE BOT IN THE TWELVE (12) MONTHS BEFORE THE EVENT GIVING RISE TO THE CLAIM.
