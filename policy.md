# Privacy Policy — Molt Bot
**Effective date:** 2026-02-08

This Privacy Policy explains how Molt Bot (the “Bot”) collects, uses, and shares information when you use it on Discord.

## Information we process
When you interact with the Bot, we may process:
- **Message content you send** in channels where the Bot is present, to generate responses and perform requested actions.
- **Discord identifiers** such as user ID, server (guild) ID, channel ID, and message ID, which are necessary to operate the Bot and maintain basic context.
- **Limited operational logs** (for example, error messages and timestamps) for reliability and debugging.

## How we use information
We use information to:
- Provide the Bot’s features and respond to requests
- Prevent abuse and keep the service stable
- Debug issues and improve performance

## Sharing / third parties
The Bot may send necessary text and metadata to third-party service providers (for example, AI/model providers) to generate responses. Those providers may process data under their own terms and privacy policies.

We do **not** sell personal information.

## Data retention
We retain information only as long as needed to operate the Bot and troubleshoot issues. Retention periods may vary depending on logs and hosting.

## Your choices
- You can stop using the Bot at any time.
- Server admins can restrict the Bot’s access using Discord permissions, or remove the Bot from the server.
