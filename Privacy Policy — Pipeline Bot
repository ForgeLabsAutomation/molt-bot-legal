# Privacy Policy — Pipeline Bot
**Effective Date:** YYYY-MM-DD

This Privacy Policy explains how **Pipeline Bot**, operated by **ForgeLabs Automation** (“ForgeLabs,” “we,” “us,” “our”), collects, uses, shares, and retains information.

> **Not Legal Advice.** This document is provided for informational purposes and is not legal advice. Consult counsel for your jurisdiction and product model.

---

## 1) Summary
Pipeline Bot is an automation bot that may:
- Read messages in authorized channels
- Process messages to execute workflows (e.g., task planning, queue processing, posting summaries/review packets)
- Store workflow state and logs in a database (often self-hosted)
- Optionally send limited content to third-party services (e.g., AI providers) depending on configuration

Admins control where Pipeline Bot operates using Discord permissions and workflow settings.

---

## 2) Information We Collect
Depending on configuration, Pipeline Bot may process:

### A) Message Content
- The text you post in channels where Pipeline Bot is active (e.g., orders/intake channels)
- Content needed to complete the requested automation tasks

### B) Message and Server Metadata
- Discord message ID, channel ID, server/guild ID
- Author ID and display name (if provided by the platform)
- Timestamps
- References/links contained in messages

### C) Workflow and System Logs
- Workflow execution status (queued/processing/done/failed/blocked)
- Error logs and debugging information
- Output pointers (e.g., which message ID a result was posted to)

### D) Integrations Data (If Enabled)
If you connect external services (calendar, CRM, ticketing, email), Pipeline Bot may process:
- Scheduling details (availability, booking confirmations)
- Lead capture fields (name/email/phone, intent)
- IDs and metadata from those systems

### E) Sensitive Data
You should avoid sending secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) via Discord messages. If such data is posted in channels where Pipeline Bot operates, it may be processed incidentally.

---

## 3) How We Use Information
We use information to:
- Execute requested workflows and automations
- Create and update queue/task state (e.g., epics, work items, review items)
- Post results into configured channels
- Troubleshoot failures and improve reliability
- Prevent abuse and enforce security guardrails

---

## 4) How We Share Information
We may share information with:

### A) Discord
Pipeline Bot necessarily exchanges data with Discord to read messages and post outputs.

### B) Service Providers (If Enabled)
Depending on your configuration, Pipeline Bot may send data to:
- AI model providers (to generate plans, summaries, drafts)
- Hosting providers (where you deploy the bot/workflows)
- Database providers
- Scheduling/Calendar providers (Calendly, Google/Microsoft calendar APIs)
- Other integrations you enable (CRM/ticketing/email)

**Important:** You control which integrations are enabled. If AI features are enabled, message content (or extracts) may be sent to an AI provider to produce outputs.

### C) Legal/Protection
We may disclose information if required by law, or to protect rights, safety, and security.

---

## 5) Data Retention
Retention depends on your deployment and configuration. Recommended defaults:
- Queue/workflow state: retain while active, and for a limited period for auditing (e.g., 30–90 days)
- Logs: retain for troubleshooting (e.g., 14–30 days)
- Outputs posted to Discord: retained per Discord’s policies and server settings

Admins may delete data by removing workflows, clearing database tables, or removing the bot from the server. If you want stricter retention, implement an automated purge job.

---

## 6) Security
We recommend:
- Least-privilege permissions for the bot
- Storing secrets in an external secrets manager (not Discord, not GitHub)
- Rotating tokens regularly
- Restricting bot access to specific channels (allowlist)
- Encrypting data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest where supported

No system is perfectly secure; you are responsible for deployment security, especially when self-hosting.

---

## 7) Your Choices and Rights
Server admins control:
- Which channels Pipeline Bot can access
- Whether AI/integrations are enabled
- Whether logs and databases are retained or purged

If you need access/deletion assistance for a managed deployment, contact us.

---

## 8) Children’s Privacy
Pipeline Bot is not intended for use by children under 13. Do not use it in environments intended for children.

---

## 9) Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. We will update the Effective Date. Continued use after updates means you accept the updated policy.
